#Discord Bot Commands
###Some simple commands created for discord bots in python.

All command prefixes are using **.** to change this simply swap out **.** with for example **!** in 

*bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix=['.'])*


I also use *if ctx.message.content == '.test':* just swap out the prefix **.** with your prefered one.
